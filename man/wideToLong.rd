\title{Transform wide format data sets into the long format necessary for \code{eatRep} analyses}
\description{Data from large-scale assessments often are provided in the wide format.
This function easily transform data into the long format required by \code{eatRep}.}
\usage{
wideToLong (datWide, noImp, imp)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{datWide}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{file} here~~
Data set in the wide format, i.e. one row per person
}
  \item{noImp}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{file} here~~
character vector of non-imputed variables which are desired for following analyses
}
  \item{imp}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{file} here~~
Named list of character vectors which include the imputed variables which are desired for following analyses
}
}
\value{
A data.frame in the long format.

### create arbitrary wide format large-scale assessment data for two
### subjects, each with three imputations
