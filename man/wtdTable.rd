\title{Computed weighted frequency tables}
\description{This functions works quite equally as the \code{\link[Hmisc]{wtd.table}} function
from the \code{Hmisc} package.}
\usage{
wtdTable(x , weights , na.rm = FALSE)}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{file} here~~
a character or category or factor vector
}
  \item{weights}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{file} here~~
a numeric vector of non-negative weights
}
  \item{na.rm}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{file} here~~
set to \code{FALSE} to suppress checking for NAs. If \code{TRUE}, NAs are removed
from \code{x} as well as from \code{weights} prior to variance estimation.
