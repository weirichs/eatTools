## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have 
* changed the description (title and text) to emphasize the purpose of the package 
* we have added a package help page, describing the package's focus in more detail (this package does NOT contain course material; it is mainly a lightweight dependency for the packages eatRep, eatGADS, eatPrep and eatModel, which will be subsequently submitted to CRAN)
* improved the R code as suggested

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.2
* OS X (on travis-ci), release
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), oldrel, release, devel
* windows (on AppVeyor), release 

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.


## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies.
