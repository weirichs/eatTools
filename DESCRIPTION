Description:
   Miscellaneous functions for data cleaning and data analysis of educational assessments. Includes functions for descriptive 
   analyses, character vector manipulations and weighted statistics. Mainly a lightweight dependency for the packages 'eatRep', 
   'eatGADS', 'eatPrep' and 'eatModel' (which will be subsequently submitted to 'CRAN').
   The function for defining (weighted) contrasts in weighted effect coding refers to
